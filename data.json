Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Mariah Stewart all spoke here, and it was the recruitment center for the 54th Massachusetts Regiment during the Civil War. At the end of the 1800s, a Jewish congregation bought the building and it served as a synagogue until 1972 when it was acquired by the Museum of African American History.",

After learning of the destruction, patriots came to see the standoff as a victory: It proved that Colonial soldiers had the resolve and determination to fight. Later generations privately funded and built the monument from 1825 until final dedication in 1843 as a testament to those who fought in the early months of the war for American Independence.",
